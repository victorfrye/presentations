## Overview

Shrug Man is an open-source static web application that allows you to easily copy the shrug emoji ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ to your clipboard. It is designed to be simple and lightweight, making it easy to use and deploy. The mission of this project is to:

🤷‍♂️ Be fun

🤷‍♀️ Be simple

🤷 Shrug
